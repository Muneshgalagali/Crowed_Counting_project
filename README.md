About
This project implements YOLOv5 for real-time crowd counting in images, videos, and live streams with 85%+ accuracy. The model is enhanced with RESNET50 and VGG16 for feature extraction, ensuring accurate detection and analysis. A Flask/Django backend is integrated with a responsive HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend for seamless visualization and real-time processing.

Features
Real-time Crowd Counting: Detects and counts people in images, videos, and live streams.
Deep Learning Integration: Uses YOLOv5, RESNET50, and VGG16 to improve detection accuracy.
Web-based Interface: Interactive UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for visualization.
Backend Processing: Handles requests and image processing via Flask/Django.
Optimized Performance: Includes test scenarios and debugging strategies to enhance model efficiency.
